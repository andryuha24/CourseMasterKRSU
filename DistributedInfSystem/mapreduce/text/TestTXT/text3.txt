In assessing these controllers on their own merits, then, I’ve taken a number of things into account. 
Comfort and durability are top of the list, but I’ve also examined how innovative they were. 
Not in gimmicky terms—the Wii’s motion controls seemed pioneering at the time, 
but how did that shake out?—but in more substantial ways, 
like overall design patterns that would be copied for generations of consoles to come.
