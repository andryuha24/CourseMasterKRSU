What is it? 
A new line of graphics tablets that let users sketch on paper and capture the result directly as an SVG or PSD file without needing to scan the drawing.

Tech specs
There are two models: the 13-inch Medium and the 17-inch Large tablet. Both ship with Wacom’s new Pro Pen 2 stylus, which supports 8,192 levels of pressure sensitivity.

Users can also clip drawing paper (A5 in the case of the Medium, A4 in the case of the Large) over the screen and draw on it with Wacom’s pressure-sensitive FineTip gel ink pen.

The pen itself also supports 8,192 levels of pressure sensitivity, and drawings are captured digitally via Wacom’s Inkspace app, with the tablet storing “up to 200 multi-layered or 1,000 one-layered drawings”.

Key competitors
There are a number of smart pen systems on the market, including Wacom’s own Bamboo Spark, but they’re smaller, less accurate, and geared more towards note-taking than drawing.

As far as we’re aware, the Intuos Pro Paper Edition is the first professional-quality graphics tablet to enable artists to draw on paper and capture the results with the same fidelity as the tablet itself.
